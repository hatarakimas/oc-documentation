In the last guide, we changed perspectives to a buyer user that has the `Shopper` role available. This provides access to some additional Me resources including the **My Products** resource.

## Listing Buyer Products
Let's retrieve a list of products available to our buyer user.

<CodeExample
  title="Get a list of buyer products"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Tokens, Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Tokens.Set("INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE")\n
Me.ListProducts()
  .then(response => {
      // returns the first page of buyer products
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(err => console.log(err.message));`,
typescript: `import { Tokens, Me, BuyerProduct, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.ListProducts()
  .then((response: ListPage<BuyerProduct>) => {
      // returns the first page of buyer products
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err.message));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
// see previous example for configuring OrderCloudClient
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
try
{
	ListPage<BuyerProduct> buyerProducts = await _oc.Me.ListProductsAsync();
} catch(OrderCloudException ex)
{
	Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}`}}
/>

Notice we did not pass any parameters yet. Your response should look something like this:

```json
{
	"Meta": {
		"Facets": [],
		"Page": 1,
		"PageSize": 20,
		"TotalCount": 1,
		"TotalPages": 1,
		"ItemRange": [
			1,
			1
		]
	},
	"Items": [
		{
			"PriceSchedule": {
				"ID": "SHIRT_PRICE",
				"Name": "Cotton T-Shirt Price",
				"ApplyTax": false,
				"ApplyShipping": false,
				"MinQuantity": 1,
				"MaxQuantity": null,
				"UseCumulativeQuantity": false,
				"RestrictedQuantity": false,
				"PriceBreaks": [
					{
						"Quantity": 1,
						"Price": 10
					}
				],
				"xp": null
			},
			"ID": "SHIRT",
			"Name": "Cotton T-Shirt",
			"Description": "A plain white, cotton shirt for everyday use.",
			"QuantityMultiplier": 1,
			"ShipWeight": null,
			"ShipHeight": null,
			"ShipWidth": null,
			"ShipLength": null,
			"Active": true,
			"SpecCount": 0,
			"VariantCount": 0,
			"ShipFromAddressID": null,
			"Inventory": null,
			"DefaultSupplierID": null,
			"AllSuppliersCanSell": false,
			"xp": null
		}
	]
}
```

As you can see, OrderCloud has flattened out the relationships between our buyer user and the `SHIRT` product. The buyer user's organization, `BUYER_ORGANIZATION`, has the default catalog `BUYER_ORGANIZATION`, which has the `SHIRT` product assigned to it with a default price schedule of `SHIRT_PRICE`.

### Buyer Product Model
My Products introduces a new OrderCloud model called `BuyerProduct` here. This type of product has a price schedule attached as a sub-object, allowing developers quick access to pricing information without needing to make additional API calls.

### List Page with Facets
Another interesting part of this response model is the `Facets` property within the `Meta` information. Facets are unique to resources that have been enhanced with elastic search in OrderCloud's backend. This topic is covered in other reading.

## Browsing Other Catalogs
The buyer product list request provides a way for buyer users to browser other product catalogs (when assigned to more than just their organizations default catalog). This can be done using the `CatalogID` option.

### Browsing by Category
If one of these other catalogs had categories in it, one would be able to filter buyer products by category using the `CategoryID` property.

Creating a unique experience entirely depends on how you take advantage of the parameters available to you. You can create a faceted product search, a category browse experience, or something completely custom using advanced querying.
